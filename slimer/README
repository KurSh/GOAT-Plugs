GOAT-Plugs: slimer plugin

== About ==
Who ya gonna call?

This plugin generates junk functions at compile time and then calls them
non-deterministically at runtime.  The "random" value used to decide which
function to call at runtime is based on time().  There is no trampoline, instead
code is generated and emitted into the input source file at compile time.

This plugin inserts a function in main() to set things up.  In other words, all
of the junk functions addresses are added to an array at runtime.  The plugin
adds code at compile which will use this array to get a random junk function to
call at runtime.

slimer_builtins.c contains helper functions to aid the choosing of functions at
runtime.  Therefore, slimer_builtins.o must be linked with the binary that is
to be compiled.

== Using ==
Two values must be specified at runtime:
    -fplugin-arg-slimer-numfuncs=<num>
    This argument creates the user defined value number of junk functions which
    will be created into the binary.

    -fplugin-arg-slimer-maxcalls=<num>
    This argument will call, at most, the user defined value number of junk
    functions at runtime.  The function called, as mentioned above, is chosen
    pseudo-randomly at runtime.  'maxcalls' does not guarantee that function
    calls will be input at compile time.  The calls are inserted randomly, and
    at most 'maxcalls' will be added.  Calls are inserted after function calls
    or assignments in the input program.

== Notes ==
* This plugin should not be used for cross-compilation

== Example ==
gcc -fplugin=./slimer.so \
    -fplugin-arg-slimer-numfuncs=3 \
    -fplugin-arg-slimer-maxcalls=40 \
    test.c slimer_builtins.o
