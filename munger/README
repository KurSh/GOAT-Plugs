GOAT-Plugs: munger plugin

== About ==
This plugin obfuscates a binary by storing all readonly strings as encoded
values.  This prevents/deters some simple forensics measures where someone might
inspect the binary for hard-coded strings.  Usually this can be done via
"strings".  Now, with this plugin, the value in the binary is not readable, as
it is encoded.  At runtime, the binary will automatically decode the value and
use it.  You write code as you normally would and this plugin does all the work.

Example:
    printf("Somewaycool shell code");
 
Your Binary would have that string stored as "gibberish" but at runtime the
"gibberish" is decoded and returned as a proper value.

This plugin works by walking each statement in the input source code, after gcc
has converted it to SSA and presents us with a GIMPLE representation for each
function.

If we encounter a value that is stored in the readonly section that is a string,
we create a global variable for that readonly constant.  This global is emitted
into the resulting binary.  We then, before the statement that would use the
readonly value, create an assignment to the global variable.

In the binary we store the encoded value, and at runtime we resolve this encoded
value, by creating a global variable (mentioned above) setting that global only
once in the program, and we pass that global to any routine that uses the
readonly.

NOTE: The current key is -1 and the input is xor'd with this at compile time to
encode the data, and xor'd again with that value (at runtime) to decode it.  Of
course, in the future I would like to add the ability to pass a user-specified
key.

[BEFORE TRANSFORMATION]
    ... code ...
    some_function(use_a_readonly_string);
    ... code ...

[AFTER TRANSFORMATION]
    ... code ...
    GLOBAL_FOR_READONLY_VARIABLE = decode(use_readonly_string);
    some_function(GLOBAL_FOR_READONLY_VARIABLE);
    ... code ...

decode() looks like this:
     IF READONLY HAS BEEN DECODED ALREADY RETURN THAT
     ELSE ALLOCATE MEMORY TO GLOBAL AND DECODE READONLY
