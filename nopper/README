GOAT-Plugs: nopper plugin

== About ==
This plugin generates no-ops and places them pseudo-randomly, at compile time,
throughout the program.  This is primarily a simple demo plugin but can aid in
obfuscating the signature of a binary.  The no-op is not 0x90 or NOP, rather it
is a junk instruction, mov eax eax.  This is less obvious to detect than NOP,
but is still pretty obvious.

== Using ==
One value should be specified at runtime:
    -fplugin-arg-nopper-numnops=<num>
    This argument specifies how many NOPs to toss in pseudo-randomly between
    statements of the input program.
    
== Example ==
gcc -fplugin=./nopper.so \
    -fplugin-arg-nopper-numnops=100 \
    test.c
